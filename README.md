# Introduction

Hey, I'm a 17 year old self-taught programmer, I've been programming for roughly 2 years now and have developed numerous systems. I'm friendly, active, a quick learner, and extremely flexible when it comes to work schedules. If you wish to contact me you can add me on discord and I will make sure to answer you as soon as I can!

# Why hire me?

I'm a hard worker who always works to land on time. I work with extreme precision, and try to match the games code style, whilst taking into account future expandibility for the system/script I'm working on. I excel in working with different people, and can quickly accomodate myself to larger working environments

# Availability & Pricing

I'm available almost every day and do not follow strict availability hours. I can easily adapt to different timezones or project schedules if necessary. I respond quickly to messages and aim to deliver progress updates frequently so you're never left waiting aimlessly.

My prices are affordable and flexible depending on the complexity of the system! I always aim to provide high quality, clean, and optimised code at a fair cost. I focus on delivering high quality results at a budget friendly rate, especially for studios or developers looking for great systems without having to overpay!

If you're unsure about the pricing for your project, feel free to contact me and I'll gladly give you an honest estimate!
